## Available Scripts

  
1-Both of the bubble plot and the bar race read a local csv file so Please just make sure that the location is Right.

2-also the bar race is the only ipynb extension i tested it with my visual studio code with the jupyter and it was working fine.

the others are normal .py that works normally by running the file

3-map 2 generates an html page already attached so no need to run that
